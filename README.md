# Bias–Accuracy Trade-off Demonstrator
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/970964930.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15265198)

## Overview

This demonstrator implements a five-step method for documenting fairness–accuracy trade-offs in high-risk AI systems, aligned with the EU AI Act and anticipated conformity documentation standards (e.g., CEN-CENELEC JTC 21, ISO/IEC 42001).

The notebook simulates label bias, applies two mitigation strategies, and produces structured artefacts for evaluation, justification, and monitoring.
